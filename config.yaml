          I'm Kuba (short for Jacob), a Software Engineer with experience in high scale distributed systems architecture, development and reliability engineering, designing systems with high availability and high throughput.

          Interested in Cloud Native tooling with a practical mindset of shipping, and building projects in as simple a way - but not simpler - as possible.

          I've got experienced with most of the widely used programming paradigms, and fancy trying out new ones, though recently I'm mostly finding myself using Go.

          On the side I develop [OctoSQL](https://github.com/cube2222/octosql), a SQL execution engine as CLI which lets you query multiple datasources and files simultaneously using SQL.

          At some point I've also created [jql](https://github.com/cube2222/jql), which is meant to be a simpler and more uniform (lispy) alternative to jq. It may seem dead on first glance, but it's simply finished. I'm using it daily.

          Finally, I've been part of the founding team of [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org), and its technical lead for almost the first year of its existence.
