      <description>Everybody has heard about the latest cool thing™, which is DALL·E 2 (henceforth called Dall-e). A few months ago, when the first previews started, it was basically everywhere. Now, a few weeks ago, the floodgates have been opened and lots of people on the waitlist got access - that group included me.
I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a day playing around with it, learned some basics (like the fact that adding &amp;ldquo;artstation&amp;rdquo; to the end of your phrase automatically makes the output much better&amp;hellip;), and generated a bunch of (even a few nice-looking) images.</description>

The Worker The Frontend The Worker The worker will communicate with the Master to get new Tasks. When it gets a Task it will get the corresponding data from the storage and will start working on the task. When it finishes it will send the finished data to the storage service, and if that succeeds it will register the Task as finished to the Master.</description>

In this short series we’ll create a web app using a microservice architecture. We’ll try not to use 3rd party tools and libraries.
