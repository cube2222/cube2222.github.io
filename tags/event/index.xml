      <description>Practical Golang: Getting started with NATS and related patterns Introduction Microservices… the never disappearing buzzword of our times. They promise a lot, but can be slow or complicated if not implemented correctly. One of the main challenges when developing and using a microservice-based architecture is getting the communication right. Many will ask, why not REST? As I did at some point. Many will actually use it. But the truth is that it leads to tighter coupling, and is synchronous.</description>

      <description>Introduction In our microservice architectures we always need a method for communicating between services. There are various ways to achieve this. Few of them are, but are not limited to: Remote Procedure Call, REST API’s, message BUSses. In this comprehensive tutorial we’ll write a service, which you can use to distribute messages/events across your system.
Design How will it work? It will accept registering subscribers (other microservices). Whenever it gets a message from a microservice, it will send it further to all subscribers, using a REST call to the other microservices /event URL.</description>
